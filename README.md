## What Is This?

Your MacBook has a powerful GPU built right into the chip. This project uses that GPU to run a massive AI model — the same kind that powers ChatGPT and Claude — **entirely on your computer**.

No internet needed. No monthly subscription. No one sees your code or data.

You get the full **Claude Code** experience — it can write code, edit files, manage projects, even control your web browser — all powered by AI running on your own machine.

```
         You
          |
     Claude Code         (the AI coding tool)
          |
   MLX Native Server     (our server — 200 lines of Python)
          |
   Qwen 3.5 122B Model   (122 billion parameter brain)
          |
    Apple Silicon GPU     (your M-series chip does the thinking)
```

## Benchmarks

We built and tested three different approaches. Each one got faster.

### Speed Comparison

```
                        Tokens per Second
  Ollama (Gen 1)        ██████████████████████████████ 30 tok/s
  llama.cpp (Gen 2)     █████████████████████████████████████████ 41 tok/s
  MLX Native (Gen 3)    ████████████████████████████████████████████████ 65 tok/s
```

### Real-World Claude Code Task

How long it takes to ask Claude Code to write a function:

```
  Ollama + Proxy          ████████████████████████████████████████████ 133 seconds
  llama.cpp + Proxy       ████████████████████████████████████████████ 133 seconds
  MLX Native (no proxy)   ██████ 17.6 seconds

                          7.5x faster
```

### Side-by-Side

| | Ollama | llama.cpp + TurboQuant | **MLX Native (ours)** |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Speed** | 30 tok/s | 41 tok/s | **65 tok/s** |
| **Claude Code task** | 133s | 133s | **17.6s** |
| **Needs a proxy?** | Yes | Yes | **No** |
| **Lines of code** | N/A (external) | N/A (C++ fork) | **~200 Python** |
| **Apple Silicon native?** | No (generic) | No (ported) | **Yes (MLX)** |

### vs Cloud APIs

| | **Our Local Setup** | Claude Sonnet (Cloud) | Claude Opus (Cloud) |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Speed | 65 tok/s | ~80 tok/s | ~40 tok/s |
| Monthly cost | **$0** | $20-100+ | $20-100+ |
| Privacy | **100% local** | Cloud | Cloud |
| Works offline | **Yes** | No | No |
| Your data leaves your Mac | **Never** | Always | Always |

---

## How We Got Here

Most people trying to run Claude Code locally hit the same wall: **Claude Code speaks one language (Anthropic API), local models speak another (OpenAI API)**. So everyone builds a proxy to translate between them. That proxy adds latency, complexity, and breaks things.

We took a different approach: **we built a server that speaks Claude Code's language natively**. No translation. No middleware. Direct.

| What everyone else does | What we did |
|---|---|
| Claude Code → **Proxy** → Ollama → Model | Claude Code → **Our Server** → Model |
| 3 processes, 2 API translations | **1 process, 0 translations** |
| 133 seconds per task | **17.6 seconds per task** |

That one change — eliminating the proxy — made it **7.5x faster**.

## What You Need

| Your Mac | RAM | Model You Can Run |
|----------|-----|-------------------|
| M1/M2/M3/M4 (base) | 8-16 GB | Small models (4B) |
| M1/M2/M3/M4 Pro | 18-36 GB | Medium models (32B) |
| M2/M3/M4/M5 Max | 64-128 GB | **Large models (122B)** |
| M2/M3/M4 Ultra | 128-192 GB | Multiple large models |

You also need:
- **Python 3.12+** (for MLX)
- **Claude Code** (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)

---

## Quick Start (4 Steps)

### Step 1: Set up Python environment

```bash
python3.12 -m venv ~/.local/mlx-server
~/.local/mlx-server/bin/pip install mlx-lm
```

### Step 2: Download the AI model

This downloads ~50 GB on first run (one time only):

```bash
~/.local/mlx-server/bin/python3 -c "
from mlx_lm.utils import load
load('mlx-community/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-4bit')
print('Done!')
"
```

### Step 3: Start the server

```bash
~/.local/mlx-server/bin/python3 proxy/server.py
```

### Step 4: Launch Claude Code

```bash
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000 \
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-local \
claude --model claude-sonnet-4-6
```

**Or just double-click** `Claude Local.command` on your Desktop. It does all of this automatically.

                    Nothing leaves this box. Ever.
```

## How It Works (Technical)

The server is a single Python file (~200 lines). It does three things:

1. **Loads the model** using Apple's MLX framework — this runs natively on your M-series GPU with unified memory (no copying data between CPU and GPU)

2. **Serves the Anthropic Messages API** — the same API that Claude Code uses to talk to Anthropic's cloud. Our server pretends to be Anthropic, but it's running on your laptop.

3. **Cleans up the output** — the Qwen model "thinks out loud" in `<think>` tags. Our server strips those so Claude Code gets clean responses.

## Browser Control

Claude Code can control your web browser too. Not a fake sandboxed browser — **your real one**, with all your logins and sessions.

| | Chrome DevTools (CDP) | Playwright |
|---|---|---|
| **What it controls** | Your real Brave/Chrome | A separate sandboxed browser |
| **Logged in?** | Yes — all your sessions | No — starts fresh |
| **Speed** | Fast | Slower |
| **Best for** | Daily tasks, logged-in work | Automated jobs, scraping |

**Example:** You can say "go to my GitHub and check which PRs need review" and it opens your actual browser, already logged in, and does it.

## When To Use This

| Situation | Use This? |
|-----------|-----------|
| On a plane with no wifi | **Yes** — full AI coding, no internet needed |
| Working with sensitive client code | **Yes** — nothing leaves your machine |
| Don't want to pay API fees | **Yes** — $0/month forever |
| Want the absolute fastest responses | Use cloud API — still faster for now |
| Need Claude's full reasoning ability | Use cloud API — local model is good but not Claude-level |

## Security

We audited every component before running it:

| Component | Source | Network Calls | Dependencies |
|-----------|--------|:---:|:---:|
| **server.py** | We wrote it | 0 | mlx-lm only |
| **MLX framework** | Apple | 0 | Apple's own |
| **Qwen 3.5 model** | HuggingFace verified | 0 | None |

No telemetry. No analytics. No phone-home. No pip packages from strangers. We even [removed LiteLLM](https://x.com/Tahseen_Rahman/status/2035501506242240520) after supply chain concerns were raised in the community.

## The Journey

We didn't start here. We went through three generations in one night:

| Gen | What We Tried | Speed | What We Learned |
|:---:|---|:---:|---|
| 1 | Ollama + custom proxy | 30 tok/s | Ollama works but Claude Code can't talk to it directly |
| 2 | llama.cpp TurboQuant + proxy | 41 tok/s | TurboQuant compresses KV cache 4.9x, but the proxy is the bottleneck |
| **3** | **MLX native server** | **65 tok/s** | **Kill the proxy. Speak Anthropic API directly. 7.5x faster.** |

Each generation taught us something. The final insight — that the proxy was the real bottleneck, not the model — changed everything.
